WooCommerce Germanized extends WooCommerce to become a legally compliant shop in the german market. Must Have for every german WooCommerce shop owner.

== Description ==

**WooCommerce Germanized** extends WooCommerce to technically match specific german legal conditions. The objective of this plugin is to adapt WooCommerce to the special requirements of german market.
Users of [WooCommerce Germanized Pro](https://vendidero.de/woocommerce-germanized "WooCommerce optimized for German Market") benefit from additional features such as PDF invoices, model text generators for terms and revocation pages, premium support and more!

= Legal certainty for WooCommerce =
WooCommerce Germanized extends WooCommerce with typical german shop functionality: Delivery times, base prices, shipping costs and tax notices, option to attach legally relevant pages (e.g. terms, revocation page, privacy policy etc.) - even in emails, small business regulation notices and many more.
Furthermore we customized the WooCommerce checkout to make your store meet the button solution. See a list of our features for further details:

= WooCommerce Germanized is certified by Trusted Shops =
WooCommerce Germanized has been approved by Trusted Shops and therefor offers best technical conditions to operate a legally binding WooCommerce Shop in Germany.
Trusted Shops certifies Shops after selected and weighted criteria and has carefully examined our WooCommerce Plugin.
Of course Trusted Shops customers may embed their quality seals or further Trusted Shops Products as genuine Seller and Product Reviews by adapting just a few options within Germanized.

= Code quality =
While developing WooCommerce Germanized we have specifically considered clean integration within WooCommerce and WordPress by adapting core functionality.
Most of the changes are made by using Hooks & Filters so that Germanized is compatible to almost every Theme.

= Pro: WooCommerce PDF invoices & packing slips =
As a Pro User of WC Germanized you may automatically or manually create PDF Invoices and Packing Slips for your orders. Doing so you may customize the PDF layout to meet your Corporate Design.
You may upload your head of a letter which will be used as background for your PDF's. With only a few clicks you may export (CSV, zip) invoices for your tax consultant or accountant.

New: Attach legally relevant pages (e.g. Terms & Conditions) as PDF documents to specific WooCommerce emails.

= Pro: Premium Support =
Customers of Woo Germanized Pro enjoy our high-quality support via tickets. Nevertheless we also seek to offer a good plugin support via our WordPress support forum.

= Tested WooCommerce Plugins =
We've added some specific compatibility and tests for certain popular WooCommerce plugins. See this list for further details:

* WPML
* PolyLang
* WooCommerce Dynamic Pricing
* WooCommerce Role Based Pricing
* WooCommerce Product Bundles

= Tested WooCommerce Themes =
To fit german requirements even better we've developed a special [WooCommerce Theme](https://vendidero.de/vendipro "WooCommerce Theme for German Market") specifically developed for the german market: VendiPro. While developing VendiPro we have considered german design principles to adapt WooCommerce to the german market.
By default, Germanized works with every WooCommerce theme. Some themes may need adjustments due to not using WooCommerce standards hooks or styles. Within our professional version we've tested certain third-party WooCommerce themes to ensure better compatibility with Germanized:

* Flatsome
* Enfold
* Storefront
* VendiPro
* Virtue
* Shopkeeper

== Installation ==

= Minimal Requirments =

* WordPress 3.8 or newer
* WooCommerce 2.4 (newest version recommended)
* PHP Version 5.3 or newer

= Automatic Installation =

We recommend installing WooCommerce Germanized through the WordPress Backend. Please install WooCommerce before installing WC Germanized.
After the installation you may easily adapt the settings to your own needs.

= Product specific shortcodes =
You may use one of the following product-specific shortcodes to output notices within PageBuilders or on custom-built-pages.
The `product` parameter is optional. Shortcodes are falling back to the global $product variable in case the `product` parameter is missing.

`[gzd_product_unit_price product="123"]`
Outputs unit price for a product.

`[gzd_product_units product="123"]`
Outputs units included with the product e.g. 100 ml.

`[gzd_product_delivery_time product="123"]`
Outputs delivery time for a product.

`[gzd_product_tax_notice product="123"]`
Outputs tax notice for a product.

`[gzd_product_shipping_notice product="123"]`
Outputs shipping costs notice for a product.

`[gzd_product_cart_desc product="123"]`
Outputs mini cart description for a product.

= General Shortcodes =

`[revocation_form]`
Inserts online revocation form within your WooCommerce store. Customer and shop manager receive a confirmation by email.

`[payment_methods_info]`
Very useful as page to inform the user of your WooCommerce payment gateways - Inserts an overview of all enabled payment gateways plus their descriptions.

`[gzd_complaints]`
Inserts a text that informs the customer about the EU Online Dispute Platform - this Shortcode should be inserted within your imprint. Find more information [here](http://shop.trustedshops.com/de/rechtstipps/jetzt-handeln-link-auf-eu-online-schlichtungs-plattform-ab-9.1.2016).

`[trusted_shops_badge]`
If you are a Trusted Shops Customer, you may insert this shortcode to insert the Trusted Shops Badge at your favourite place.
By adjusting parameter width=55 (55 means 55px width/height) you may optionally set badge's width.

`[trusted_shops_rich_snippets]`

= Updating WooCommerce Germanized =

Before updating WooCommerce you should definitely check whether WooCommerce Germanized does already support the newest version. 
You may of course Update WooCommerce Germanized automatically through the WordPess Backend. Please make sure to always backup (at least your database) before updating any theme or plugin.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Where do I receive support for WooCommerce Germanized? =

You may ask your questions regarding WooCommerce Germanized within our free [WordPress Support Forum](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/woocommerce-germanized).
Professional ticket-support is being offered to [Professional Users](https://vendidero.de/woocommerce-germanized "Support for WooCommerce Germanized") only.

= Not every option fits my WooCommerce Theme =

Unfortunately not every Theme does implement WooCommerce in the way it's meant to be or differs from the original structure which leads to layout and/or compatibility 
issues. Out of that reason we have developed [VendiPro](https://vendidero.de/vendipro) which perfectly fits all Germanized Options and is optimized for German Market.

= Email attachments not showing in WooCommerce order confirmation email =

In most times you have a wrong configuration within your Germanized Email settings. The order confirmation email sent to the customer after an order has been made is called "Processing Order". The email called "New Order" is the email
sent to the Administrator which serves as a notification only - so make sure you have "Processing Order" selected within the Germanized settings.

= Want to file a bug or improve WooCommerce Germanized? =

Bug reports may be filed via our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/vendidero/woocommerce-germanized).
