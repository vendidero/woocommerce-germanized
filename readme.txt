= Add shipments to WooCommerce orders =
Germanized adds a new abstraction layer to WooCommerce to make it easier for you to send your parcels to your customers. With Germanized you'll be able to generate (multiple) shipments to an order.
You can then manage your shipments and it's statuses independently from your orders. Let your customers receive a notification email as soon as a shipment has been marked as shipped including tracking information from a built-in or manually added shipping provider. Learn more about our [Shipments for WooCommerce](https://vendidero.de/woocommerce-germanized/features#shipments "Shipments for WooCommerce") integration and find out how to automate your shipping process.

Managing returns can be a time-consuming challenge. By using Germanized you might let your customers create return requests through their customer panel. All you need to do is confirm the request through your return dashboard and your customers will receive an email containing further steps on how to return their product(s).
In case you are using our DHL integration you might as well (automatically) create a label to the return which will be attached to the email sent to the customer.

With the help of our Post, DHL, UPS, DPD (Pro) and GLS (Pro) integration you can easily create labels for your shipments and add tracking information to the notification emails. Furthermore you can offer DHL preferred delivery services to your customers including shipping to Packstation or choosing a drop-off location and/or day within the checkout.

With a little help from our [One Stop Shop compliance plugin for WooCommerce](https://wordpress.org/plugins/one-stop-shop-woocommerce/) bundled within Germanized you'll handle the new EU VAT regulations with ease. Generate new VAT reports for different time frames and let the plugin
observe the delivery threshold automatically to make sure you'll get notified in case you are close to reaching the threshold and need to take action.

`[gzd_email_legal_page_attachments email_id="customer_processing_order"]`
This shortcode outputs the legal page content attached to a specific email template. In case the email_id attribute is missing the shortcode tries to determine the current email template being sent.
The shortcode is useful to output the legal page attachments in custom email templates built via a GUI (e.g. email customizer plugins).

= Updating Germanized for WooCommerce =

You may of course Update Germanized for WooCommerce automatically through the WordPess Backend. Please make sure to always backup (at least your database) before updating any theme or plugin.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Where can I find the documentation? =
[Germanized Documentation](https://vendidero.de/doc/woocommerce-germanized/home-germanized)

= Need help? =

You may ask your questions regarding Germanized for WooCommerce within our free [WordPress Support Forum](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/woocommerce-germanized).
Professional help desk support is being offered to [Professional Users](https://vendidero.de/woocommerce-germanized "Support for WooCommerce Germanized") only.

= Not every option fits my WooCommerce Theme =

Unfortunately not every Theme does implement WooCommerce in the way it's meant to be or differs from the original structure which leads to layout and/or compatibility
issues. For testing purposes, please activate a default WordPress Theme (such as TwentyX) and see whether the issues persist.

= Using a Pagebuilder? =

In case you are using a Pagebuilder (e.g. Elementor, Divi-Builder) you might want to replace the default [shopmarks](https://vendidero.de/doc/woocommerce-germanized/preisauszeichnungen-anpassen) placed by Germanized with our custom [shortcodes](https://vendidero.de/doc/woocommerce-germanized/preisauszeichnungen-anpassen#pagebuilder).

= Email attachments not showing in WooCommerce order confirmation email =

In most times you have a wrong configuration within your Germanized email settings. The order confirmation email sent to the customer after an order has been made is called "Processing Order". The email called "New Order" is the email
sent to the Administrator which serves as a notification only - so make sure you have "Processing Order" selected within the plugins' settings.

= Want to file a bug or improve Germanized for WooCommerce? =

Bug reports may be filed via our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/vendidero/woocommerce-germanized).
